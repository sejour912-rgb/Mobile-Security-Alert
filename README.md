## App Ideas: 
App that lets the civil protection alert people in many areas when there are natural disasters such as: winds,rain,thunderstorms,landslide,hurricane,floods,tsunami and so one, to make sure that everyone is safe by following the civil protection’s rules.
This app share with people different kind of alert every time.

## Final App Idea:
This app will be useful not only for the civil protection, but also for people even though some of them can not read. They only need to have an internet connection. When they receive a notification ,only one click will lead them to a clear audio message.

User stories: User will be able to choose the video version of the message if they want to see some pictures while listening to it.
